The web crawler that finds services and their location and stores that information in the database.

Run "main.py" to start the spider

# Final Summary:

The plan for this was to have a crawler running that would search for potential charities and upload them to the AHOCHI server.  The problem with this approach was that a majority of these sites are spread out.  Useful information is spread across multiple pages and determining how to combine that information in a useful way was very hard, and not successful in the end.
